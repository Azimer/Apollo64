New todo for Apollo64

*** Visual Studio 2019 ***
- Create Emulation Loop to call existing CPU Core without attached devices
- Revamp attached devices to emulate a basic non-functional output to get passed the basics for demos
- Build up interface to allow an attached graphical display to show basic emulation (ie. N64Stars)
*** Cmake ***
- Revamp CPU Core and Emulation loop to fit new design -- at this point we go to cmake projects
